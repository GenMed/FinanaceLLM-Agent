# Summmary Of Step Loading RAG and connected from websource implememtation

#### 1. Data Loading
- Utilizes the `WebBaseLoader` class to fetch data from a specified URL.
- Data is loaded into the `data` variable for further processing.

#### 2. Vector Database Creation
- Defines the `create_vector_db()` function to create a vector database.
- Utilizes `WebBaseLoader` to load data from a different URL for vectorization.
- Processes and splits the loaded documents into chunks for vectorization.
- Vectorization is performed using the `Chroma` class with `OllamaEmbeddings`.
- The resulting vector store is persisted to a specified directory.
- Returns the created vector store.

#### 3. Query Prompt Template
- Defines the `QUERY_PROMPT` prompt template, serving as a template for AI model inputs.
- Includes placeholders for input variables, such as the user's question.

#### 4. Dependencies Installation
- Installs dependencies using shell commands, including Ollama and neofetch.

#### 5. Ollama Language Model Initialization
- Initializes an Ollama language model (LLM) with a specific version (`gemma:2b`).

#### 6. Retrieval and Answer Generation
- Sets up a multi-query retriever using the `MultiQueryRetriever` class.
- Defines a RAG prompt template for generating answers based on retrieved context and user questions.
- The retrieval process involves querying the vector database with the user's question and generating answers based on the retrieved context.
- Extracts and returns the final answer.

## ##7. Invocation
- Defines a chain of operations including retrieving context, processing questions, generating prompts, running the language model, and parsing the output.
- Invokes the chain with a sample question ("What is gross margin KPIs?").
- Displays the generated answer, along with relevant information, as the output.



## Technical RAG

#### 1. Data Loading
- **Definition:** The process of acquiring data from various sources such as websites, documents, code repositories, APIs, file directories, databases, etc., to be used in subsequent analysis or processing.
- **Additional Info:** RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems are designed to access data from diverse sources, including websites, HTML pages, documents (Word, PDF), code repositories, APIs, file directories, and databases. This step involves extracting data from these sources for further processing.

####  2. Embeddings
- **Definition:** Embeddings are numerical representations of data that capture meaningful relationships between entities. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), word embeddings are vector representations of words, capturing semantic and syntactic similarities.
- **Additional Info:** Embeddings play a crucial role in machine learning and AI models as they transform textual data into numerical form, enabling computational operations. They encode semantic information about words or entities in a vector space, facilitating tasks such as similarity search and language understanding.

## ##3. Storing
- **Definition:** Storing refers to the process of persisting data, such as embeddings, in a structured format for future retrieval and usage.
- **Additional Info:** In the context of RAG systems, storing involves saving preprocessed data, including embeddings, in a vector database. Vector databases specialize in indexing and storing embeddings for efficient retrieval and similarity search. They enhance traditional database features with capabilities tailored for handling vector data.

#### 4. Retrieval
- **Definition:** Retrieval is the process of searching and fetching relevant pieces of information (documents) from a dataset or database in response to a user query or prompt.
- **Additional Info:** Retrieval is a critical step in RAG systems, where the retriever module retrieves documents that are relevant to the user's query or prompt. It involves matching the query against indexed data, such as embeddings stored in a vector database, and returning the most relevant documents as output.
